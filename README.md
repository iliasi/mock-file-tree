# A mock file tree explorer React app
A simple react app that displays file tree structure in the browser


## TODO

- Make the UI larger and readable
- Implement a full blown file tree with drag and drop capabilities
- Split the UI into 2 sections i.e to display file contents when selected

## Credits
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- File Icons were extracted from [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)
